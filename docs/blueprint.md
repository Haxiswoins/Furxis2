## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0), a desaturated near-neutral to complement the light theme and lavender accents.
- Accent color: Pale orange (#E0C6B0), an analogous color with slightly different brightness and saturation than the primary to contrast CTAs and UI highlights.
